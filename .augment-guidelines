<Rules>
* You MUST always use context7 to know up-to-date documentation of each library which you are going to use before writing any code
* You MUST always respect the style, structure, and architecture of the code already written in the project, but feel free to suggest and explain proposed improvements
* Check typescript and eslint errors using Current JetBrains IDE MCP tool
* The less code the better and easier to maintain in the future
* Before proceed, give me a summary of the current state. Before writing code, make sure how a similar task has already been implemented in the project, follow the style of existing code.
* Do not delete comments
</Rules>

<Tips>
* Current app is already running and opened in active browser tab, which available by Browser MCP tool, you must not to navigate to it!
* `get_project_problems` mcp tool is not working and always returns empty problems array. To check problems open target file and use `get_current_file_errors` mcp tool.
* Don't use `execute_terminal_command` mcp tool, it's not working, use your native terminal tool.
